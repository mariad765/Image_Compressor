# Image_Compressor
Compress and Decompress files

## Introduction

The "Image Compression and Decompression System" is an efficient solution for handling image compression and decompression processes. This project is designed to work with files of the format "compressedX_Y.out," where X represents the index of the example file, and Y signifies the compression factor applied. For example, "compressed1_3000.out" is the resulting file when a compression factor of 3000 is applied to "example1.ppm." The corresponding decompressed files are named "decompressedX_Y.ppm."

## Features

List some of the key features of your project.

- Compression Tree Data Structure: The core of our project is the Compression Tree, which intelligently organizes and compresses image data. This innovative approach allows for a higher degree of compression without compromising image quality.
- Dynamic Compression Factor: Users have the flexibility to choose the compression factor (Y) when compressing images. This feature enables you to balance image quality and file size according to your specific needs.
-  Streamlined File Naming: The project simplifies the management of compressed and decompressed files by using a consistent naming convention. Files are named in the format "compressedX_Y.out" for compressed files and "decompressedX_Y.ppm" for decompressed files.

## Technologies

Project written in C. Working with PPM files.

## Tasks Described

This project was originally a homework for the data structure course. So it is made following different tasks.

Compressed files are of the form "compressedX_Y.out" where X is the index of the example file, and Y 
is the compression factor applied.
Example: "compressed1_3000.out" is the resulting file from applying the compression algorithm with 
a factor of 3000 to "example1.ppm".
Decompressed files have names like "decompressedX_Y.ppm" where X is the index of the compressed 
file, and Y is the compression factor applied.
Example: "decompressed1_3000.ppm" is the decompression of the file "compressed1_3000.out".

Title: Implementation of the compression tree.
I defined two structures: Grid and Tree. I created a matrix using the Grid structure to store the image 
pixels, and allocated it dynamically. To build the quaternary compression tree, I created the insert 
function, which recursively inserts nodes into the tree. For this, the color score calculated using a 
formula needs to be checked and taking into account the toleration, the tree will have more leaves or 
not. The score will be calculated for each part of the matrix. If the node is not a leaf (a node can be a 
leaf only if the score is lower than maximum score accepted), the matrix will be divided into four parts, 
and for each smaller matrix, a new score will be calculated to determine the node type. I iterate 
through the large matrix without modifying it. I use the dimension for this purpose, and I have an X 
and Y that will traverse within the limits of this dimension, which halves for each quarter of the 
previous matrix part.
To read the information from the given ppm file, I used a trick because some images had a newline 
before the binary data, and others did not. I used fseek to skip the header and read the information in 
binary.
For initializing the tree, I considered the following default settings: the type is 0, the pixels are 0, and 
the dimension is always received as an argument. Each node has 4 children, which are initialized as 
NULL. I created the countLevel function, which returns the number of levels in the tree. It is a recursive 
function with the base case of the root being different from NULL, returning 1. The maximum between 
this value and the value returned for the children is taken. When the last pointer is null, the function 
returns 0.
I created the countLeaves function, which recursively calculates the number of leaves, and the 
maxLeafSize function, which calculates the maximum size in a leaf node. Since the maximum was 
required multiple times, I created a macro to assist with the calculations.

Title: Image compression
I implemented the compression tree. For this task, I created the writeOnLevel function and 
implemented a queue. The working principle is as follows: the root node of the tree is inserted into 
the queue, whose size corresponds to the number of nodes at that level. Initially, the size is 1. I created 
a gSize function to quickly extract the current size of the queue. I check the type of the queue head, 
and based on the type, I write the necessary information to the file. This node is then removed from 
the queue; if it has children, they will be added to the queue, thus obtaining the size of the next level. 
I also created the other functions specific to a queue: createQueue, enqueue, dequeue, destroyQueue.

Title: Construction of the decompression compression tree
For decompression, we need to reconstruct the tree read level by level from the file. I used a queue 
and followed a similar principle as in the previous exercise. I created a read function that reads the 
data from the file and creates the tree. I created an empty queue to track the levels of the tree. I read 
the image dimension from the file and create the root node of the tree. The root node is then added 
to the queue. While the queue is not empty, we iterate through all the elements of the current level. 
For each element, we extract the first node from the queue and read the node type from the file. If 
the node type is a leaf, i.e., the pixel value from the file, read the pixel values and store them in the 
current node. If the node type is internal, i.e., a node that contains four children, create four child 
nodes and assign them in the required order within the square tree. The children are added to the 
queue. The root is returned, and the queue is destroyed. After obtaining the tree, I built the image 
matrix. The function allocates memory for the 2D matrix and initializes it with default values. Then, 
the function traverses the tree and fills the corresponding pixels in the grid matrix. Finally, the function 
returns the matrix. The getGridAdd() function is an auxiliary function called within this function, which 
fills the grid matrix with the appropriate values from the tree. In addition, if the current node is a leaf, 
the function sets the corresponding pixels in the grid matrix to the color value. If the current node is 
not a leaf, the function recursively traverses the four sub-matrices and fills the grid matrix with the 
corresponding values from the tree. Finally, the function returns the 2D matrix. The last function, which 
is also called in the main function, is toPpm. This function takes a file (fp), a 2D matrix (grid), and the 
size of the matrix (size) as parameters. The function writes the data from the grid matrix to a PPM 
format file. The function starts by writing the PPM file header, which includes the matrix size and the 
maximum color value. Then, the function traverses the matrix and writes the color values of each pixel 
to the PPM file. Finally, the function closes the file. This function is useful for writing the data from the 
grid matrix to a PPM format file, which can be opened and visualized to see the corresponding image 
of the tree.
